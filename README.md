### What **Overcast** is (work‑in‑progress)

Running a full Solana RPC validator just to fetch live blocks can be expensive and operationally heavy—you have to maintain the Accounts DB, voting logic, and terabytes of long‑lived data you may never use. **Overcast** is being built as a lightweight alternative: a “CDN‑style” node that ingests Turbine shreds, keeps only the recent ones, and helps the network heal itself through repair traffic.

Overcast:

* Listens for incoming shreds, spots gaps, and issues repair requests.  
* Processes repair responses and re‑assembles blocks locally.  
* Serves valid shreds to neighbours that ask.  
* Maintains a rolling shred cache (retention window is configurable—default is around an hour).

Because it drops anything outside that window and skips the Accounts DB, vote engine, and RPC layer, Overcast can run on the same machine as heavier applications or on a small VPS, using a fraction of the resources a validator needs. Tools like Mithril, indexers, or monitoring agents can point to a local (or remote) Overcast instance to stream blocks directly without relying on centralized RPC services—yet Overcast remains fully usable as a stand‑alone cache for anyone who just wants fast, low‑footprint access to fresh Solana data.
